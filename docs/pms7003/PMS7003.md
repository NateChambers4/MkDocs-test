# **Connect PMS7003 and Bojack DHT11 Sensors to Raspberry Pi 3**

This guide provides instructions on how to connect a PMS7003 Particle Matter Sensor and a Bojack DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor to a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian and use the Python script `tPMS_blynk.py` to read and send data from the sensors.

## Sensor Connection Guide

### Bojack DHT11 Sensor
1. Connect the `-` pin of the DHT11 sensor to the ground (GND) pin 9 on the Raspberry Pi 3.
2. Connect the `+` pin of the DHT11 sensor to the 5V power pin 2 on the Raspberry Pi 3.
3. Connect the `OUT` pin of the DHT11 sensor to GPIO 17 pin 11 on the Raspberry Pi 3.

### PMS7003 Particle Matter Sensor
1. Connect the `VCC` pin of the PMS sensor to the 5V power pin 4 on the Raspberry Pi 3.
2. Connect the `GND` pin of the PMS sensor to the ground (GND) pin 6 on the Raspberry Pi 3.
3. Connect the `RX` pin of the PMS sensor to GPIO 15 (RXD) pin 10 on the Raspberry Pi 3.
4. Connect the `TX` pin of the PMS sensor to GPIO 14 (TXD) pin 8 on the Raspberry Pi 3.

After correctly connecting the sensors to your Raspberry Pi, you can now run the Python script to collect and send sensor data. Please follow the steps in the previously provided guide to run the `tPMS_blynk.py` script.

## Safety Note
Remember, when working with electronic components, always turn off the power supply when connecting or disconnecting sensors or other components. This will help prevent accidental damage.

## Troubleshooting
- If your script fails to read data from the sensors, check the wiring again to make sure all connections are correct and secure.
- Ensure that the pins used in the script match the pins you have connected your sensors to. In this guide, DHT11's OUT pin is connected to GPIO 17 (pin 11) and PMS's RX and TX pins are connected to GPIO 15 (pin 10) and GPIO 14 (pin 8) respectively. You may need to adjust your script if your connections differ.
