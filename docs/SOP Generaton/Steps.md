# Creating SOPs Using ChatGPT: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Steps
1\. **Turn Off ChatGPT Chat History**: 
   - Navigate to settings, select data controls, and turn off chat history for privacy. Learn more about data management [here](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt).

2\. **Upload Required Files**: 
   - Upload the necessary 'Style Guide' and an example SOP from [this link](https://www.google.com).

3\. **Initial Prompt to ChatGPT**: 
   - Enter the following prompt and submit it with the uploaded files:

      I have given you two files. I want you to first look at the one called
      "style guide." This will be a guide for all future SOPs. I want you to take note
      of every detail that is needed. After that, look through the second file. I want
      you to take note on how they are written, what information is given, how much
      detail and explaining is done within every section. Report back to me with your
      findings of every document. After your respond, I will supply you with a list of
      questions that I have answered.

4\. **Prepare and Answer Questions**: 
   - Copy and answer the list of questions detailed in the SOP creation guide from [Outline Questions](Outline%20Questions.md).

5\. **Provide Questions and Answers to ChatGPT**: 
   - Give ChatGPT the following prompt along with your prepared document:

      Here are my questions along with answers. Please use them as a guide to create
      your own SOP document. You may need to fill in some details or make them longer to
      complete the SOP fully. Please ask me if you need any other specific information
      before you start. Once ready, please create copiable markdown code for the SOP.


6\. **Generate and Review SOP Markdown**: 
   - ChatGPT will generate markdown code for your SOP. Use [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) to review and format it.
   - Copy your revised markdown code to [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/md-to-docx) to download your created SOP as a Word document. Styling changes will be necessary.

## Limitations
- With chat history turned off, direct file downloads from ChatGPT are not possible. We use markdown to format SOPs.
- Currently, access to ChatGPT Enterprise is not available for small businesses, limiting direct document creation and downloads. This is said to be changing soon, and this guide will be updated accordingly.
